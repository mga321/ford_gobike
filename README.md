# Name:

Ford GoBike Analysis


# Description:

This project is an exploratory data analysis of Bay Wheels (formerly Ford GoBike), the San Francisco/Bay Area bike share company operated by Lyft.

The entire analysis will be an exploration into similarities, differences, and patterns between user types with a focus on demographic characteristics and an initial look into month-to-month comparisons.


# The Data:

The data has been collected from the company's official website here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html. Due to the start date of this project, the analysis only contains data up until May 2019. All data from June 2019 and on has **NOT** been included.

The dataset for the analysis is not included in the repository. To recreate this analysis, use the link in the above paragraph and download all datasets from 2017-fordgobike-tripdata.csv to 201905-baywheels-tripdata.csv.zip. Feel free to further explore by also downloading additional months' datasets. However, if additional data is added, the code may require adjustments.
